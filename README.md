# - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Grizak
### - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, mods and minecraft

All of these websites are programed in HTML, Javascript and CSS.

They are going to be maintained every five years from they are done

I have programed most of them myself. With the help of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). 

I'm currently learning java to program a minecraft mod ([linked up there somewere](https://minecraft-sound-engineers.github.io/Minecraft-SoundEngineers---Main-Mod/)), so dont hezitate me if there is something i'm doing wrong in there. 

I'm also just 13 years old, so dont put too much presurre on me.

If you will want to give input you can make a draft in my [project](https://github.com/users/Grizak/projects/7/views/1).
